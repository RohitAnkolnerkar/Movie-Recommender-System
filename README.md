# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

This project is a **Movie Recommender System** that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze movie data and generate personalized recommendations.

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 Recommend movies based on user input
- 🧠 Uses content-based filtering / collaborative filtering (customize as per your implementation)
- 🔍 Search for similar movies by title
- 📊 Visualize movie similarities and metadata (optional)
- 🗂️ Clean and structured dataset processing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data processing
- **Scikit-learn** – feature extraction and similarity computation
- **Streamlit / Flask** – optional web interface
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for development and experimentation

## 📂 Dataset

The system uses the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset, which contains user ratings and movie metadata. Alternatively, you can use any movie dataset that includes:
- Movie titles
- Genres
- Tags / Descriptions
- Ratings (for collaborative filtering)

## 📈 Recommendation Approaches

### Content-Based Filtering
- Vectorizes movie descriptions using TF-IDF
- Computes cosine similarity between movies
- Recommends movies with high similarity scores

### Collaborative Filtering (optional)
- Analyzes user-item interactions
- Uses matrix factorization or k-NN to find similar users/movies

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender.git
   cd movie-recommender
